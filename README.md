I have created separate models for each target:
- weekly sales for each shop and department 
- markdowns 1-5 for each shop and department 
- total sales
First exploratory is shown in notebooks/EDA.ipynb 

In scripts directory thera are two .py files - one for preparing data (merging, cleaning, etc) and other for training and evaluating models. 

In notebooks directory there is explanatory file - showing predictions for test set and 2013 year.
